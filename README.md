# Snake
A recreation of the game Snake made in pygame. My first game I ever made without a tutorial, but revamped so the code is far simpler, more object-oriented and readable.

## Installation:
Download and extract Snake.zip.

## Run:
Run Snake.exe.

## Disclaimer:
I have no idea how to write a readme
